## Optimal Path-Finding Algorithm for Electric Cars

### Introduction
This project focuses on implementing an optimal path-finding algorithm in the C programming language. The goal is to facilitate efficient navigation between gas stations for electric cars, taking into account the battery capacity of each vehicle.

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop an algorithm that calculates the optimal route for electric cars to travel between gas stations, ensuring that they can manage their fuel consumption effectively. Unlike traditional vehicles, electric cars rely on battery capacity, which necessitates careful planning to ensure they reach their destinations without running out of power.

### Implementation
The algorithm is implemented in C language, leveraging various data structures and algorithms to calculate the most efficient path between gas stations. It considers factors such as the distance between stations, the remaining battery capacity of the car, and the energy consumption rate to determine the optimal route. In particular, it has been implement a specific ad-hoc algorithm in order to achieve the desired functionality; other possible solutions were given by the customization of the already known Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Final score
My final grade was 27/30.
